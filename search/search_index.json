In addition to having practical and theoretical knowledge in software and mechatronics engineering I am also a people person and enjoy to connect and work with others. Furthermore, I am an effective technologies communicator as I have spent most of my time educating others about engineering and software.</p> <p>With my track record of projects and employment, I have proven my skills in communication, team-work, problem solving, managing, and being punctual. Although my career has largely been focused on academia and education, I am interested in real-world industry experience to develop my skills as an engineer and make meaningful contributions to people\u2019s lives.</p>"}]}
