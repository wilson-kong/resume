I am a highly motivated individual with expertise in software and mechatronics engineering. I am also a people person who enjoys connecting and working with others. My passion for learning is matched with an ability to effectively communicate complex technical concepts, honed through education and project experience. A career primarily centered on writing software and programming, additional involvement in industry and the startup space has leveraged proven  technical and soft skills to a high degree.
