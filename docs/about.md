I am a highly driven person who loves to learn. In addition to having practical and theoretical knowledge in software and mechatronics engineering I am also a people person and enjoy to connect and work with others. Furthermore, I am an effective technologies communicator as I have spent most of my time educating others about engineering and software.

With my track record of projects and employment, I have proven my skills in communication, team-work, problem solving, managing, and being punctual. Although my career has largely been focused on academia and education, I am interested in real-world industry experience to develop my skills as an engineer and make meaningful contributions to peopleâ€™s lives.
